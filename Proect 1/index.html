                <h2>What is web design?</h2>
                <p>Many young or new designers often misunderstand the concept of web design. Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the <a href="https://www.mockplus.com/blog/post/user-experience-definition">user experience </a></p>
                <p>aspects of website development rather than software development. Therefore, even someone without any technical knowledge can become a great web designer using platforms like<a href="https://www.mockplus.com/?home=1">Mockplus,</a><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/blog/figma-vs-sketch/"> Figma or Sketch.</a></p>
                <p> Of course, it would be great if you know some coding language (HTML, CSS, Java), but you can’t get yourself deep into front-end development, that’s not the core of web design. The core of web design is visual and interaction. It aims to solve the communication problems between users and web page information.</p>

                <h2>What skills do web designers need to have?</h2>
                <p>As young designers, you may feel confused about what skills to master when you start your career. In this part, we will explore the top skills that a young web designer must have. Now, let’s dive in.</p>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Simply speaking, visual design is the process of improving the UI and UX of a web/app through visual elements and effects, including colors, illustrations, photography, typography, layouts, white spaces and the like. In contrast to UI design, it focuses more heavily on the visual effects of web/app design and aims to engage users. As beginners, if you want to have a great visual design, you need to bear the basic principles of scale, visual hierarchy, balance, contrast and gestalt in mind, which can help you to drive engagement and increase usability.</p>
